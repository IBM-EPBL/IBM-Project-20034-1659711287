Python,Jupyter Notebook, IBM Cloud, IBM Watson Studio, Jira, Deep Learning, Python-Flask
#📖Project Description:
Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes. Better water supplies and sanitation, as well as better management of water resources, can contribute greatly to poverty reduction and economic growth. It is known that contaminated water and inadequate sanitation facilitate the transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio. Those without access to clean water and sanitation face preventable health risks. We are going to implement a water quality prediction using machine learning techniques. In this technique, our model predicts that the water is safe to drink or not using some parameters like Ph value, conductivity, hardness, etc
